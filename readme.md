🧭 CareerCompass: The Freshman Survival Guide
"Find your direction before you commit four years of your life."

🎓 The Problem
Choosing a college major is one of the most significant financial decisions a person will ever make, yet many students choose based on gut feeling rather than data. With the average student graduating with $37,000 in debt and 1 in 3 graduates expressing regret within five years, there is a clear need for better transparency.

🚀 The Solution
CareerCompass is a data-driven tool built for the Bama Builds Hackathon. It calculates a Regret Probability Score (RPS) by analyzing the intersection of financial, macroeconomic, and institutional data.

⚖️ How the RPS is Calculated
Our proprietary algorithm doesn't just look at salary; it weighs six critical metrics:

Starting Salary (NACE 2024)

Average Student Debt

10-Year Job Growth (BLS)

Automation Risk (AI task-exposure research)

Unemployment Rate

Reported Job Satisfaction

🛠️ Key Features
Custom Weighting: Students can adjust the weights to reflect what matters most to them (e.g., prioritizing happiness over pay).

Debt Stress Penalty: The score automatically increases if projected debt exceeds 150% of the starting salary.

Institutional Modifier: Includes a ranking modifier for over 200 universities, including the University of Alabama, to account for institutional ROI.

Freshman Action Plan: Provides actionable "Next Steps" based on the risk level of the chosen major.
